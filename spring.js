// The curve the notch grows on (copied from graveklar.face common/spring.js).
//
// It is the step response of a damped second-order system: the thing a spring
// actually does, which is to overshoot once by a known amount and settle, and
// not the wobble `Easing.OutElastic` draws. `damping` is the damping ratio ζ,
// and the overshoot follows from it alone:
//
//     overshoot = exp(-πζ / √(1-ζ²))        ζ = 0.72 → 3.8 %
//
// NumberAnimation cannot be handed a formula, only a cubic Bézier spline, so
// the closed form is sampled into one: `segments` Hermite pieces, C¹ because
// each piece takes its end slopes from the same closed form rather than from
// a difference. Eight pieces hold it to about 0.002 of the true curve, which
// is a fifth of a pixel on a 100 px card.
//
// A curve on the animation, rather than a formula applied to a linear timer,
// is what lets a restart mid-flight pick up from wherever the card currently
// is, and lets an exit run without playing the overshoot backwards.
//
// `peakAt` is where in the duration the overshoot peaks, as a fraction: 0.6 of
// a 350 ms grow is 210 ms in. By t = 1 the envelope is under half a percent,
// and that residual is removed linearly so the curve ends on exactly 1.
